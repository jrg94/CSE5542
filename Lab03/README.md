# CSE 5542 Lab 03 Directions

Since all this code is hosted on GitHub, you can run this solution
using the [RawGit tool][9].

Alternatively, you can open the solution locally by double-clicking the
HTML file to run the solution in your browser. Personally,
I tested on **Google Chrome** and **Windows 10**.

With the solution open, you can begin playing with the following controls:

- left click + drag: rotation

The solution should render as follows:

Source credit goes to Dr. Han-Wei Shen who provided the template code via their
[OSU course website][2]. Namely, [`code08.html`][3], [`code08.js`][4],
and [`shader_setup_5.js`][7].

Changes to these templates included:

1. Moving shaders out of HTML and into a [`shaders.js`][8] file.
2. Improving software craftmanship.
